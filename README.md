Documenting my process of getting my Synology DS418 to be a WebDAV server for Zotero so I don't need to pay $120/year

**Work in Progress, check [Issues](https://github.com/ryanamannion/zotero-synology/issues) page**


## Description

Zotero allows users to sync two categories of things: data and files. Files are the actual files attached to the entries (pdfs, webpages), and "data" is everything else (e.g. library items, notes, links, tags, etc.) [[src]](https://www.zotero.org/support/sync). Data syncing is free and unlimited, while file syncing has 300MB free with additional paid storage up to $120/year for unlimited file storage. 

I don't want to pay that. This repo is me documenting the process of setting that up in October 2021. Hopefully this will help somebody.
